# FullStack Experiment Repository

A collection of my experiments and worksheets demonstrating my full-stack learning journey. This repo holds various labs, front-end & back-end practices, and mini-projects built while studying Computer Science Engineering.

## 🔍 About

- This repo contains zipped experiment files (Exp 1, Exp 2, Exp 4, Exp 5, etc.), worksheets, frontend & backend practice work.  
- Purpose: to track progress, showcase hands-on skills, maintain a versioned archive, and have something concrete to show for interviews or project submissions.

## 🚀 How To Use / Run

For each experiment:

1. Unzip the `.zip` file.  
2. Open the folder (often you’ll find `index.html`, CSS, JS files for front-end experiments).  
3. If backend (if any), set up as described in the experiment’s folder (install dependencies, run server, etc.).  
4. For experiments which need special setup (e.g. database, APIs), instructions will be added soon.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or frameworks if any)  
- **Backend**: [NodeJS, Python, PHP, etc – fill what you used]  
- **Tools**: Version control via Git/GitHub, any build tools or package managers you used  
- **Others**: Anything else relevant (e.g. databases, cloud services)

## 🎯 Future Work

- Add individual READMEs in each experiment to explain purpose, setup, and learning outcomes.  
- Refactor code for better modularity and readability.  
- Add screenshots / demo links.  
- Make some experiments interactive or live (hosted) so others can try directly.  
- Add tests / documentation if any.
